# Introduction

This is my repo for our async class. The last time I did this activity in class, my teammate and I had barely set up our codespace and sharing (via the VSCode extension) before we ran out of time. Then, for the second one, I believe I wasn't present. So, for this one, I started entirely from scratch. Notably, I used AI to help get everything set up, as downloading NPM and everything on my new machine was taking some time. From there, I spent time creating the outline of the website. Because I've never really used React before, I knew that in the timeframe I had, I wouldn't be able to get everything done, so I tried to challenge myself to match the aesthetic of a different website rather than focus on something else. Still, I was able to host the website on Vercel. 

Notably, I tried to make my website look like Uber, which was fun, and let me use some of the tools I picked up on during class (inspect element, etc.), so I felt pretty good about the exercise overall, and like I learned something new while reinforcing other stuff we did in class.
